rev8 candidacy exam (param revE and concentric E)
	--> larger betas, wider airgap range, 
	more J for ext rotor
	revA has badly designed stator
	revB has optimized stator, but its teeth are too long, so it becomes apparently too advantageous (in comparison to slotless)
	revC makes slots shorter... l_slot=2 mm, to compete with the slotless, whose biggest radial coil thickness is 2 mm
	revD is C but with 'circular' geometry
