Anomaly (2) - Warning:
The group of volume regions:
   - IRON_ST
is multiply connected (have hole(s)).
 
There can be a problem called connexity problem if a coil forms
an interlacing with the group of volume regions.
 
If you have a connexity problem, you must create a cut of
magnetic circuit which cuts the group
of volume regions.
